It feels fast and snappy although I tuned my computer to the lowest power consumption possible and the power profile is powersave. It reserves less virtual memory and doesn't create the hiccups Gnome terminal and the great Blackbox were giving this machine and the lag/drag of Alacritty (with all due considerations and respect for devs and comunity).
